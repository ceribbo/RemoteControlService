# RemoteControlService  

### Abstract

Remote Control Service is an accademic project developed for the Pervasive System class at Sapienza Universit√† di Roma, Master Degree in Computer Engineering A.Y. 2017-18
The goal of the project is to provide a cheap and versatile monitoring system, in order to make your room safer.
The main advantage of our solution, compared to the existing services on the market, is the possibility to access the sensors through a Telegram chat terminal.

#### MVP
The initial goal of the project was to equip the system with two simple functionalities:

+ Send current snapshot from the camera whenever the movement sensor detects a change in the environment
+ Send current snapshot from the camera whenever the user sends a command through the Telegram chat

Those snapshots will be sent inside the Telegram chat.

In an advanced stage, we developed a Beta functionality: the user can record a video up to 30 seconds, through two commands.
This feature has been implemented and then presented for the final submission. 

## Idea
The idea was born during a talk with other colleagues; most of them, who shared a room or an apartment with other students,
agreed that there is a lack of cheap solutions to improve security in this kind of context. 

## Presentation

## Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/davegimo/RemoteControlService/blob/master/dd.png "architecture")

Basically, whenever the sensor detects a movement, the Nucleo Board will send a HTTP Request to the Back-end.<br>
The IOT-Application will send to the Telegram chat the current snapshot.
Same thing happens when the user sends a command message to the Telegram Bot.

On the side of the Raspberry, it will send every second the current snapshot. This way the Application of our Back-End is always updated and doesn't have to send an explicit request to the Raspberry.
## Hardware 

+ Webcam
